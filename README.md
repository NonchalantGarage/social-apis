# Social APIs

Social APIs is an app that gives you the structural backend and routes to set up a social network app. It uses the Model View Controller design pattern that allows you to add users, user thoughts, which are similar to comments, and reactions to comments, which are similar to replies. These routes have been tested via Insomnia with proper validations built into the models using Mongoose.
