# Social APIs

Social APIs is an app that gives you the structural backend and routes to set up a social network app. It uses the Model View Controller design pattern that allows you to add users, user thoughts, which are similar to comments, and reactions to thoughts, which are similar to replies. These routes have been tested via Insomnia with proper validators built into the schemas using Mongoose.
